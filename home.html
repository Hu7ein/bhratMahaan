<strong><u>Ancient History</u></strong><br /><br />
India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human civilization. It beginswith a mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming communities in the southern lands of
India. The history of India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating people with the diverse
cultures that surround India. Available evidence suggests that the use of iron, copper and other
metals was widely prevalent in the Indian sub-continent at a fairly early period, which is indicative of
the progress that this part of the world had made. By the end of the fourth millennium BC, India had
emerged as a region of highly developed civilization.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<b><u>The Indus Valley Civilization</u></b><br /><br />
The History of India begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization, more precisely known as
Harappan Civilization. It flourished around 2,500 BC, in the western part of South Asia, what today is
Pakistan and Western India. The Indus Valley was home to the largest of the four ancient urban
civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China. Nothing was known about this civilization till
1920s when the Archaeological Department of India carried out excavations in the Indus valley
wherein the ruins of the two old cities, viz. Mohenjodaro and Harappa were unearthed. The ruins of
buildings and other things like household articles, weapons of war, gold and silver ornaments, seals,toys, pottery wares, etc., show that some four to five thousand years ago a highly developed
Civilization flourished in this region.<br />

The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the people lived in well-planned
and well-built towns, which were also the centers for trade. The ruins of Mohenjodaro and Harappa
show that these were magnificent merchant cities-well planned, scientifically laid, and well looked
after. They had wide roads and a well-developed drainage system. The houses were made of baked
bricks and had two or more storeys.<br />

The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat and barley constituted
their staple food. They consumed vegetables and fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well.
Evidences also show that they wore cotton as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan
culture came to an end. Among various causes ascribed to the decay of Indus Valley Civilization are
the recurrent floods and other natural causes like earthquake, etc.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<b><u>Vedic Civilization</u></b><br /><br />
The Vedic civilization is the earliest civilization in the history of ancient India. It is named after the
Vedas, the early literature of the Hindu people. The Vedic Civilization flourished along the river
Saraswati, in a region that now consists of the modern Indian states of Haryana and Punjab. Vedic is
synonymous with Hinduism, which is another name for religious and spiritual thought that has
evolved from the Vedas.
The Ramayana and Mahabharata were the two great epics of this period
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<b><u>The Buddhist Era</u></b><br /><br />

During the life time of Lord Gautam Buddha, sixteen great powers (Mahajanpadas) existed in the 7th
and early 6th centuries BC. Among the mmore important republics were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu and
the Licchavis of Vaishali.</p>
<hr />

<p>
<b><u>Alexander's Invasion</u></b><br /><br />

In 326 BC, Alexander invaded India, after crossing the river Indus he advanced towards Taxila. He
then challenged king Porus , ruler of the kingdom between the rivers Jhelum and Chenab. The Indians
were defeated in the fierce battle, even though they fought with elephants, which the Macedonians
had never before seen. Alexander captured Porus and, like the other local rulers he had defeated,
allowed him to continue to govern his territory.
</p>
<hr />


<p>

<b><u>Gupta Dynasty</u></b><br /><br />

After the Kushanas, the Guptas were the most important dynasty. The Gupta period has been
described as the Golden Age of Indian history. The first famous king of the Gupta dynasty was
Ghatotkacha's son Chandragupta I. He married Kumaradevi, the daughter of the chief of the
Licchavis. This marriage was a turning point in the life of Chandragupta I. He got Pataliputra in dowry
from the Lichhavis. From Pataliputra, he laid the foundation of his empire and started conquering
many neighbouring states with the help of the Licchavis. He ruled over Magadha (Bihar), Prayaga and
Saketa (east Uttar Pradesh). His kingdom extended from the river Ganges to Allahabad. Chandragupta
I also got the title of Maharajadhiraja (King of Kings) and ruled for about fifteen years.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>The Rise of Islam in South-Asia</u></b><br /><br />
The initial entry of Islam into South Asia came in the first century after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The Umayyad caliph in Damascus sent an expedition to Baluchistan and Sindh in 711 led by Muhammad bin Qasim. He captured Sindh and Multan. Three hundred years after his death Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the ferocious leader, led a series of raids against Rajput kingdoms and rich Hindu temples, and established a base in Punjab for future incursions. In 1024, the Sultan set out on his last famous expedition to the southern coast of Kathiawar along the Arabian Sea, where he sacked the city of Somnath and its renowned Hindu temple.
</p><hr />
<p>
<b><u>Timur's Invasion</u></b><br /><br />
It was during the reign of the last king of the Tughlaq dynasty that the mighty king Timur or Tamerlane invaded India in 1398 A.D. He crossed Indus and captured Multan, and just walked over to Delhi without much resistance
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<b><u>The Mughal Empire</u></b><br /><br />
In India, the Mughal Empire was one of the greatest empires ever. The Mughal Empire ruled hundreds of millions of people. India became united under one rule, and had very prosperous cultural and political years during the Mughal rule. There were many Muslim and Hindu kingdoms split all throughout India until the founders of the Mughal Empire came. There were some men such as Babar, grandson to the Great Asian conqueror Tamerlane and the conqueror Genghis Khan from the northern region of Ganges, river valley, who decided to take over Khyber, and eventually, all of India.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world.

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions.By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organized system of belief. In south India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of southeast Asia.

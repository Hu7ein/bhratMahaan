        Daman  is the capital city of the Indian union territory of Daman and Diu. It is a municipal council situated in Daman district of the union territory.

Daman is divided by the Daman Ganga River into two parts — Nani-daman (nani meaning "small") and Moti-daman (moti meaning "big"). Despite its name, Nani-daman is the larger of the two parts, while the old city is mainly in Moti-Daman. The downtown area holds most of the important entities like the major hospitals, supermarkets and major residential areas. Vapi, Gujarat is the nearest city to Daman.

<p><b>History<b><br />
The Portuguese Diogo de Melo arrived at the spot by chance in 1523, when heading towards Ormuz. He was caught in a violent storm and had his boat blown towards the coast of Daman.[2] Soon after, it was settled as a Portuguese colony which lasted for over 400 years. A larger fort was built in Moti Daman in the 16th century to guard against the Mughals who ruled the area until the Portuguese arrived. It stands today, most of it preserved in its original form. Today the majority of the municipal government offices are inside the fort.

Daman was incorporated into the Republic of India in December 1961 after a battle between the Portuguese and the Indians. The battle left four Indians dead and 14 wounded; Portuguese casualties were 10 dead and two wounded.
